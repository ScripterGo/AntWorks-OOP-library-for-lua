# AntWorks-OOP-library-for-rbxLua
AntWorks features a very powerful yet simple approach to object oriented programming in rbxLua. Get started by visiting the setup page within the repository.

## Features
AntWorks supports most of which an OOP library would need, some of which is:

**Inheritence** - Very flexible inheritance allowing both objects and classes to inherit from multiple sources.

**DataTypeLimits** - Supports limitations to the datatype of the value which can be set at index.

**Multimethods** - Supports the creation and usage of multimethods.

**readOnly/locked properites** - The ability to lock indexes making them readOnly. You could also lock the entire object and then unlock specific indexes.

**Events** - Allows you to easily create new custom events, with easy and simple management of connections helping you avoid memory leaks.
 
**Changed event** - Including a changed event which will fire whenever an index-s value within your AntObject is changed.
